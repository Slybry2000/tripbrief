## Log

### 2026-09-12 - f33b224
Created a new standalone React and Convex project with the neutral TripBrief
identity. Established a local Convex deployment, installed the official Convex
agent rules and hackathon logging skill, and documented public-data and submission
boundaries before adding product features (`package.json`, `AGENTS.md`,
`README.md`).

### 2026-09-12 - 9b525dc
Built the local brief-to-comparison workflow with authenticated ownership,
numbered requirements, exact-source offer evidence, and human-controlled selection
(`convex/trips.ts`, `convex/schema.ts`, `src/App.tsx`). Build, lint, and four
backend tests pass. A fictional browser walkthrough verified sign-in, brief creation,
offer capture, and selection. Added Firecrawl search with a live five-result browser
check and owner-only, deduplicated partner shortlists (`convex/research.ts`,
`convex/partners.ts`, `src/PartnerResearch.tsx`). Eight tests and lint pass.
Added transactional per-workspace and app-wide research quotas using the registered
rate-limiter component. Nine tests and lint pass, including burst-limit rejection.
Research remains restricted to an enabled test workspace during integration testing.
OpenAI, AgentMail, and public deployment remain unfinished.

### 2026-09-12 - 9b525dc
Added a review-only OpenAI analysis action that returns structured, exact-source
evidence for every requirement; it cannot select or save an offer (`convex/analysis.ts`).
Added on-demand AgentMail inbox provisioning for each brief without sending email
(`convex/inboxes.ts`). Twelve tests, lint, and the production build pass. Live
OpenAI and AgentMail calls remain deliberately unrun while usage is being reviewed.
